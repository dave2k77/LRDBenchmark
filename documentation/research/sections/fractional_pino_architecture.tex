\section{Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Operators: Novel Architecture for Long-Range Dependence Estimation}

\subsection{Architecture Innovation and Design Principles}

Our Fractional PINO architecture represents a significant advancement in physics-informed neural networks, specifically designed for long-range dependence estimation in neurological time series. The architecture integrates three key innovations: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with fractional calculus \cite{li2020fourier}, multi-scale feature extraction with attention mechanisms \cite{vaswani2017attention}, and a modular physics-informed constraint system \cite{raissi2019physics}. This novel combination addresses fundamental challenges in long-range dependence estimation while providing a robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework for clinical applications.

The core innovation lies in the integration of FNOs with fractional calculus, creating the first neural operator framework specifically designed for fractional parameter estimation. This combination enables efficient learning of mappings between function spaces while incorporating the mathematical rigor of fractional calculus operators \cite{kilbas2006theory, oldham1974fractional}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Neural Operator Core: Fourier Neural Operator Integration}

The foundation of our architecture is the Fourier Neural Operator, which performs spectral convolution in the Fourier domain:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Fourier Layer Implementation]
class FourierLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, modes=16):
        self.weights = nn.Parameter(
            self.scale * torch.rand(in_channels, out_channels, modes, dtype=torch.cfloat)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # FFT → Weight multiplication → IFFT
        x_ft = torch.fft.rfft(x)
        out_ft = torch.einsum("bix,iox->box", x_ft, self.weights)
        return torch.fft.irfft(out_ft, n=x.shape[-1])
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Key Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spectral Domain Learning}: Direct learning in frequency space for scale-invariant features
    \item \textbf{Efficient Convolution}: O(n log n) complexity through FFT operations
    \item \textbf{Complex Weight Learning}: Complex-valued weights for enhanced representational capacity
\end{itemize}

This spectral approach is particularly advantageous for long-range dependence estimation, as it naturally captures scale-invariant features that are fundamental to Hurst parameter estimation \cite{mandelbrot1968fractional, hurst1951long}.

\subsection{Multi-Scale Feature Extraction with Attention}

Our multi-scale design captures features at multiple temporal resolutions through parallel convolution layers and intelligent scale combination:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Multi-Scale Layer Design]
self.multi_scale_layers = nn.ModuleList([
    nn.Conv1d(hidden_dims[-1], hidden_dims[-1], kernel_size=k, padding=k//2)
    for k in [3, 5, 7, 11]  # Multi-scale kernels
])

self.scale_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
    embed_dim=hidden_dims[-1], num_heads=4, batch_first=True
)
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Design Principles:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scale Diversity}: Kernel sizes [3, 5, 7, 11] capture different temporal patterns
    \item \textbf{Attention Mechanism}: Multi-head attention for intelligent scale combination
    \item \textbf{Feature Fusion}: Adaptive combination of multi-scale representations
\end{itemize}

The multi-scale approach is crucial for long-range dependence estimation, as it enables the model to capture temporal correlations across different time scales simultaneously \cite{he2016deep, szegedy2015going}.

\caption{Multi-scale feature extraction with attention mechanism. The architecture processes input features through parallel convolution layers with different kernel sizes [3, 5, 7, 11], followed by multi-head attention for intelligent scale combination and feature fusion.}
\label{fig:multi_scale_processing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Physics-Informed Constraint Framework}

Our physics-informed framework provides a modular system for incorporating physical laws through constraint-based learning:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Physics Constraint System]
class PhysicsConstraints(nn.Module):
    def compute_total_constraint_loss(self, t, y, hurst):
        # Modular system for different physics constraints
        pass

class FractionalMellinTransform(nn.Module):
    def compute_constraint_loss(self, t, y, hurst):
        # Mellin transform constraint
        pass
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Constraint Types:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fractional Derivative Constraints}: Enforce fractional calculus relationships
    \item \textbf{Mellin Transform Constraints}: Spectral domain consistency
    \item \textbf{Scale Invariance Constraints}: Maintain scale-invariant properties
    \item \textbf{Memory Effect Constraints}: Preserve long-memory characteristics
\end{enumerate}

The constraint system ensures that the learned operator respects the underlying physics of long-range dependence, leading to more robust and interpretable results \cite{kantelhardt2002multifractal, torre2007wavelet}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{physics_constraint_framework.png}
\caption{Physics-informed constraint framework showing the integration of fractional derivative constraints, Mellin transform constraints, and scale invariance constraints. The framework computes constraint violations and integrates them into the multi-objective loss function.}
\label{fig:physics_constraints}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Loss Function Design and Multi-Objective Optimization}

The multi-objective loss function balances multiple objectives to ensure both data fitting and physical consistency:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Multi-Objective Loss Function]
total_loss = data_loss + 0.1 * physics_loss + 0.1 * operator_loss + 0.05 * hurst_loss
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Loss Components:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Loss}: MSE between predicted and true function values
    \item \textbf{Physics Loss}: Constraint violation penalties
    \item \textbf{Operator Loss}: Operator learning objectives
    \item \textbf{Hurst Loss}: Hurst exponent estimation accuracy
\end{itemize}

This balanced approach ensures that the model learns to approximate the data while maintaining physical consistency and operator learning objectives.

\subsection{Fractional Calculus Integration and Robustness}

Integration with authentic fractional calculus libraries provides mathematical rigor while maintaining computational efficiency:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Fractional Operator Integration]
try:
    import core as hpfracc_core
    import special as hpfracc_special
    HPFRACC_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    HPFRACC_AVAILABLE = False
    # Fallback implementations
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Integration Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Authentic Operators}: Mathematically rigorous fractional derivatives
    \item \textbf{Multiple Definitions}: Caputo, Riemann-Liouville, Weyl, Marchaud
    \item \textbf{Fallback Mechanisms}: Robust operation under various conditions
    \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Graceful degradation when libraries unavailable
\end{itemize}

The integration with authentic fractional calculus libraries ensures mathematical rigor while the fallback mechanisms provide robustness for deployment in various environments.

\subsection{Training Framework and Implementation}

The complete training infrastructure includes physics-aware training with constraint enforcement:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Training Step Implementation]
class FractionalPINOTrainer:
    def train_step(self, batch_data, batch_targets, batch_hurst):
        # Forward pass with physics constraints
        output_function, predicted_hurst = self.model(batch_data)
        
        # Multi-objective loss computation
        total_loss = self.compute_total_loss(...)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        total_loss.backward()
        self.optimizer.step()
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Training Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics-Aware Training}: Constraint enforcement during training
    \item \textbf{Multi-Objective Optimization}: Balanced optimization of multiple objectives
    \item \textbf{Learning Rate Scheduling}: Adaptive learning rate adjustment
