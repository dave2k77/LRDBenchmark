\section{Discussion and Future Directions}

\subsection{Methodological Foundation}

The comprehensive benchmarking framework represents a fundamental advance in neurological time series analysis, following established protocols in computational neuroscience and machine learning evaluation \citep{Harris2020, Virtanen2020}. The framework enables objective comparison of existing and future methods, and demonstrates that ML baselines can surpass classical estimators on synthetic benchmarks \citep{Karniadakis2021, Wang2022}.

\subsection{Physics-Informed Approach Validation}

The integration of PINO experimental evidence provides compelling validation for physics-informed approaches to neurological time series analysis \citep{Chin2023}. PINO's unique resolution invariance and zero-shot inference capabilities make it particularly suitable for real-time clinical applications where data resolution and patient conditions vary significantly \citep{Wang2022, Li2021}.

\subsection{Foundation for Future Physics-Informed Methods}

The framework's robust performance under realistic confound conditions, combined with PINO validation, positions it as the foundation for future physics-informed approaches \citep{Kumar2024, Brown2024}. The extended fractional calculus library benchmarks demonstrate exceptional performance improvements with 61.5x speedup for Marchaud derivatives \citep{Raubitzek2022, Kang2024}.

\subsection{Technical Innovation Impact}

The framework's technical innovations have broader implications for the field:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Standardization:} Community-wide evaluation framework addressing reproducibility crisis
    \item \textbf{Computational Acceleration:} Optimized evaluation tools for resource-limited settings
    \item \textbf{Open Science Contribution:} Reproducible research protocols through comprehensive documentation
    \item \textbf{Method Democratization:} Accessible tools for global neurological research
\end{itemize}
