## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v1.5.x to v1.6.0

#### New Import Structure
```python
# Old way (v1.5.x)
from lrdbench.analysis.machine_learning.cnn_estimator import CNNEstimator

# New way (v1.6.0)
from lrdbench import CNNEstimator
```

#### Enhanced Estimators
```python
# All enhanced estimators are now available directly
from lrdbench import (
    CNNEstimator,      # Enhanced CNN with residual connections
    LSTMEstimator,     # Enhanced LSTM with bidirectional architecture
    GRUEstimator,      # Enhanced GRU with attention mechanisms
    TransformerEstimator  # Enhanced Transformer with self-attention
)

# Use immediately with pre-trained models
estimator = CNNEstimator()
result = estimator.estimate(data)
```

#### Streamlit Dashboard Updates
- Dashboard now supports all 18 estimators
- ML and neural estimators appear with ü§ñ and üß† emojis
