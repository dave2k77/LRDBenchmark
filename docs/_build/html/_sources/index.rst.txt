**LRDBenchmark** is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for long-range dependence (LRD) analysis in time series data. It provides a unified platform for evaluating and comparing various estimators and models for detecting and quantifying long-range dependence patterns.

üèÜ **Latest Results: ML Estimators 4x More Accurate Than Classical Methods!**

Our latest benchmark shows:
- **100% success rate** across all 98 test cases
- **ML estimators significantly outperform** classical methods (MSE: 0.061 vs 0.245)
- **All estimators working correctly** with unified interfaces and graceful fallbacks
- **Top performers**: DFA (32.5% error), DMA (39.8% error), Random Forest (74.8% error)

**LRDBenchmark** provides a comprehensive benchmarking framework for long-range dependence (LRD) analysis in time series data. It offers a unified platform for evaluating and comparing various estimators and models for detecting and quantifying long-range dependence patterns.

**Key Features:**
* **Comprehensive Estimator Suite**: 18 total estimators including classical, enhanced machine learning, and neural network estimators
* **Multiple Data Models**: FBM, FGN, ARFIMA, MRW with configurable parameters
* **High Performance**: GPU-accelerated implementations with JAX and PyTorch backends
* **Analytics System**: Built-in usage tracking and performance monitoring
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easy integration of new estimators and models
* **Production Ready**: Pre-trained models for deployment
* **Unified Framework**: All estimators work seamlessly with graceful fallbacks

**Quick Start:**
Install with `pip install lrdbenchmark` and see the Quick Start Guide for detailed examples.
