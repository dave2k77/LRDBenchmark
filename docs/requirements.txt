pandas>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# This prevents installation issues on ReadTheDocs while still allowing
# documentation to be generated with proper type hints and imports.

# Additional documentation tools for enhanced ML/neural network docs
# (These are already included above, no duplicates needed)

# For better type hint handling in enhanced estimators
typing-extensions>=4.0.0
