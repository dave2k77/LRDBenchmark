# üìÑ **Paper Restructuring Summary: Focus on Benchmarking**

## üéØ **What We Changed**

Successfully restructured the research paper to focus on comprehensive benchmarking results rather than physics frameworks, since we have solid data for the benchmarking but not for the physics-informed neural operators.

## üìù **Key Changes Made**

### **1. Title Update**
- **Old**: "Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Operators: A Novel Architecture for Long-Range Dependence Estimation"
- **New**: "Comprehensive Benchmarking of Long-Range Dependence Estimators: Performance Analysis Across Classical and Machine Learning Methods"

### **2. Abstract Refocus**
- Removed physics framework claims
- Emphasized 945 benchmark tests across 12 estimators
- Highlighted clinical applications and quality leaderboard
- Focused on evidence-based results

### **3. Introduction Restructure**
- **Old Focus**: Novel neural architecture with physics constraints
- **New Focus**: Comprehensive benchmarking for clinical applications
- Updated contributions to emphasize benchmarking framework
- Revised paper organization to reflect new structure

### **4. Related Work Update**
- **Removed**: Neural operators and physics-informed networks
- **Added**: Classical LRD estimation methods (temporal, spectral, wavelet, multifractal)
- **Added**: Benchmarking and performance comparison literature
- **Added**: Machine learning approaches (brief overview)

### **5. Section Removal**
- **Removed**: Architecture Design (03_architecture_design.tex)
- **Removed**: Physics-Informed Framework (04_physics_informed_framework.tex)
- **Removed**: Implementation and Capabilities (05_implementation_capabilities.tex)

### **6. Content Updates**
- **Abstract**: Now focuses on benchmarking results
- **Introduction**: Emphasizes clinical validation and method selection
- **Related Work**: Covers classical methods and benchmarking gaps
- **Theoretical Analysis**: Quality scoring methodology and statistical validation
- **Conclusion**: Clinical recommendations and evidence-based guidance
- **Appendix**: Detailed benchmarking setup and reproducibility information

## üìä **New Paper Structure**

### **Main Paper File**
- `main_paper.tex` - Updated to include only relevant sections

### **Active Sections (8 total)**
1. `00_abstract.tex` - Benchmarking-focused abstract
2. `01_introduction.tex` - Clinical applications and benchmarking motivation
3. `02_related_work.tex` - Classical LRD methods and benchmarking gaps
4. `06_benchmarking_methodology.tex` - Comprehensive methodology
5. `07_benchmark_results.tex` - Quality leaderboard and analysis
6. `08_neural_framework_analysis.tex` - Neural results (where available)
7. `09_theoretical_analysis.tex` - Quality scoring and statistical validation
8. `10_conclusion_future_work.tex` - Clinical recommendations
9. `11_references.tex` - Updated bibliography
10. `12_appendix.tex` - Benchmarking details and reproducibility

### **Removed Sections (3 total)**
- `03_architecture_design.tex` - No longer relevant
- `04_physics_informed_framework.tex` - No quality data available
- `05_implementation_capabilities.tex` - Not applicable to benchmarking focus

## ‚úÖ **Benefits of Restructuring**

### **Modular Structure Maintained**
- Easy to add neural results when available
- Can extend with additional contamination scenarios
- Flexible for different publication venues

## üéØ **Key Results Emphasized**

### **Top Performers**
1. **CWT (Wavelet)** - 87.97 quality score, 100% success rate, 9ms processing
2. **R/S (Temporal)** - 86.50 quality score, 100% success rate, 80ms processing
3. **DFA (Temporal)** - 83.45 quality score, 11.93% error rate (highest accuracy)

### **Clinical Applications**
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: CWT and R/S for continuous EEG monitoring
