\begin{abstract}
We present a comprehensive benchmarking study of long-range dependence (LRD) estimation methods, evaluating the performance of classical and machine learning approaches across multiple contamination scenarios. Our study includes 945 total tests across 12 estimators and 8 contamination types, providing robust statistical validation of estimator performance under realistic clinical conditions. The benchmark evaluates estimators from four categories: temporal methods (DFA, R/S, DMA, Higuchi), spectral methods (GPH, Periodogram, Whittle), wavelet methods (CWT, Wavelet Whittle, Wavelet Log Variance, Wavelet Variance), and multifractal methods (MFDFA). Our results establish CWT (Wavelet) and R/S (Temporal) as top performers with 100\% success rates and sub-100ms processing times, making them ideal for real-time clinical applications. The comprehensive quality leaderboard provides critical insights for clinical applications in neuroscience, finance, and other domains requiring robust long-range dependence estimation, with specific recommendations for real-time monitoring, high-accuracy analysis, and rapid screening scenarios.
